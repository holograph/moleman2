1
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,040
So it continues, but where did it start?
אז זה ממשיך, אך כיצד זה החל?

2
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Independent artists, sportsmen outside the law...
אמנים עצמאיים, ספורטאים מחוץ לחוק...

3
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,640
The colorful culture of the city has become
a platform for a variety of forms of self-expression.
התרבות הצבעונית של העיר הפכה לבמה
למגוון דרכים של הבעה עצמית.

4
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,600
A human thought, visuals, beats and melodies, the sculpting of scents 
and materials to unique shapes can all express a human emotion.
מחשבה אנושית, אמצעים חזותיים, מקצב ומנגינה, הפיסול של ריחות
וחומרים לצורות יוצאות-דופן - כל אלה מסוגלים להביע רגש אנושי.

5
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,480
But what happens if someone chooses 
to express themselves through numbers?
אך מה קורה אם מישהו בוחר
להביע את עצמו דרך מספרים?
6
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,800
In the 1980’s, something changed the world forever.
בשנות ה80' של המאה העשרים, קרה משהו
ששינה את העולם לעד.

7
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Computer technology, mostly due to the appearance 
of affordable Commodore 64’s, entered households worldwide,
טכנולוגית מחשבים, בעיקר עקב הופעתו בשוק של הקומודור 64 (Commodore),
חדרה למילוני בתים ברחבי העולם,

8
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,640
providing the opportunity for everyone to create digital art.
ונתנה אפשרות לכל אחד ואחת ליצור אמנות דיגיטלית.

9
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,320
But existing art forms weren’t the only ones
to be re-implemented on these computers;
לא רק סוגי אמנות מוכרים (ציור, מוסיקה)
הופיעו על המחשבים הללו;

10
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,920
brand new forms of art also appeared,
ones thought to be impossible up to that point.
גם סוגים חדשים ולא מוכרים של אמנות
הופיעו, שעד לזמן זה לא היו אפשריים.

11
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
Computers provided an opportunity for the
creator to produce visuals and sound effects
הופעת המחשבים סיפקה הזדמנות ליוצרים
להפיק אפקטים חזותיים וקוליים,

12
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
and combine them to create the ultimate audiovisual experience,
לשלב אותם לחוויה האור-קולית האולטימטיבית,

13
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,800
by using only the language of mathematics and
writing program code, without physical interaction.
באמצעות אך ורק שפת המתמטיקה וכתיבת קוד
תוכנה, ללא כל אלמנט פיסי או מכני.

14
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,520
As a result of such techniques, demos were born,
and with them, the demoscene subculture.
כתוצאה מההתנסות בטכניקות הללו נולדו
הדמואים (demos), ואיתם נולדה הסצינה (demoscene).

15
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,880
A demo can best be understood as a spectacular
animated music video which is usually a few minutes long.
אפשר לחשוב על דמו כעל קליפ מוסיקלי מרהיב,
שבדרך כלל אורך מספר דקות בודדות.

16
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,160
And yet it’s something entirely different from a traditional video.
עם זאת, דמואים שונים באופן מהותי מוידאו מסורתי.

17
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
- So it’s not a video or an audio file.
- אז זה לא קובץ וידאו או מוסיקה.

18
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
- No, it’s an executable program.
- Yes, it’s software.
- לא, זו תוכנה ברת-הרצה (executable).
- תוכנה?

19
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,640
- Yes, it’s software like like a computer game.
- כן, זוהי תוכנה לכל דבר, כמו...
  כמו משחק מחשב.

20
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
People who play video games may 
be familiar with the term 'demo'.
אנשים המכירים משחקי מחשב עשויים להכיר
את המונח 'דמו'.

21
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,960
This software, however, should not be confused
with the artworks demosceners call 'demos'.
יש להבחין בין תוכנות כאלה (הדגמות למשחקי מחשב)
ליצירות האמנות להם חברי הסצינה קוראים "דמואים".

22
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:53,640
- Game demos are promotional copies of the game 
that have, for example, two levels out of two hundred.
- דמואים למשחקים הם עותקים של המחשק שהופקו
  לצרכי שיווק עם, נאמר, שני שלבים מתוך מאתיים.

23
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,920
- A demo in the demoscene is an artwork
that has nothing to do with game demos.
- דמו במינוחי הסצינה הוא יצירת אמנות,
  שאין לה כלל קשר למשחקי מחשב.

24
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,520
They do have one thing in common though:
Demos are made using the same techniques as video games,
עם זאת, יש להם דבר אחד במשותף:
הם נבנים באמצעות אותן טכניקות,

25
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,200
the same skills are needed to create them,
and they both end up as executable programs.
אותן יכולות נדרשות כדי ליצור אותם,
ושניהם מסיימים כתוכנה ברת-הרצה.

26
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Of course, there are many differences along the way.
כמובן, יש הרבה הבדלים בתהליך.

27
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,840
- If you’re making a game professionally, or if you’re
making a game even for, even for you and your friends,
- אם אתה יוצר משחק באופן מקצועי, או אפילו
  אם אתה עושה זאת בשבילך והחברים שלך,

28
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,600
- there is a set thing that you have to follow.
With the demoscene, you can pretty much break all that.
- יש יעד מוגדר היטב, ומסגרת ברורה לביצוע.
  עם דמואים ניתן לשבור את המסגרת באופן חופשי.

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Has a self-admitted problem with finishing demos.
מודה בראש רוצות שיש לו בעיה לסיים דמואים.

31
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,120
- You can either do abstract, you can have a plan.
There are so many different things,
- אפשר ליצור מופשט, או ליצור על פי תוכנית.
  יש כל כך הרבה אפשרויות,

32
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,360
- and the creativity involved and just being able,
the freedom involved to doing whatever the heck you want to.
- והיצירתיות הנדרשת והיכולת... החופש שמאפשר
  לעשות פשוט מה לכל הרוחות שבא לך.

33
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,920
- You can encounter problems in the scene
that ignite your programming creativity,
- אתה עשוי להיתקל בבעיות בסצינה
  שמציתות את היצירתיות התכנותית שלך,

34
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,880
- to find out how to do something 
more simple, smaller, more efficiently.
-  כדי לגלות איך לעשות משהו בצורה
   פשוטה יותר, קטנה יותר, יעילה יותר.

35
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:16,400
- The point of a demo is to create an music-video-like experience 
using visuals and audio that you can really enjoy watching.
- הפואנטה של דמו היא ליצור חויה כמו של קליפ מוסיקה
  באמצעים חזותיים וקוליים שהיוצר באמת נהנה מהם.

36
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,280
- Some friends sit down - coders, designers, graphicians, 
musicians - and they decide to do something spectacular,
- כמה חברים נפגשים - מתכנתים, מעצבים, גרפיקאים,
  מוסיקאים - והם מחליטים לעשות משהו מרהיב,

37
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,440
- or not spectacular but fun to do.
And then they decide to show it to others too.
- או לאו דווקא מרשים אבל שכיף לעשות.
  ואז הם מחליטים להראות את זה גם לאחרים.

38
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,480
- That’s the concept, a gratifying hobby you can enjoy.
- זה הרעיון, תחביב מספק שאפשר להנות ממנו.

39
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,880
- Most people haven’t studied this. In fact,
I don’t think anyone has studied this,
- רוב האנשים לא חקרו את הנושא. למעשה, אני
  לא חושב שמישהו אי פעם חקר את הנושא,

40
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,720
- everyone here is a self-taught programmer, artist, musician.
From this perspective, it’s a naive artform.
- כולם פה מתכנתים, אמנים, מוסיקאים שלימדו
  את עצמם. מנקודת המבט שלנו זוהי צורת אמנות תמימה.

41
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:07,760
- Apart from being an outlet for self-expression,
the demoscene doesn't make much sense as it is today.
- לבד מלתת פורקן לצורך בהבעה-עצמית,
  אין הרבה הגיון בסצינה כפי שהיא כיום.

His demo Chaos Theory, created in his demotool Addict,
has been shown in the United States at Siggraph,
הדמו שלו 'תורת הכאוס' (Chaos Theory), אותו יצר באמצעות
כלי שפיתח בשם Addict (מכור), הוצג בכנס Siggraph היוקרתי בארה"ב,

44
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
the world’s most renowned computer graphics conference.
הכנס המפורסם בעולם הגרפיקה הממוחשבת.

45
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,920
- People always made demos for fun.
- אנשים תמיד יצרו דמואים בשביל הכיף.

46
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,920
- And of course back in the day, to show off to each other,
“Look, what I did with this computer.”
- ובזמנו, כמובן שגם רצו להשוויץ,
  "תראו מה עשיתי עם המחשב הזה!"

47
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,320
- In the ‘90s when we started getting serious about
this kind of stuff, we were continually surprised by demos,
- בשנות ה90', כשהתחלנו לקחת את העניין ברצינות,
היינו מופתעים כל פעם מחדש מדמואים,

48
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,160
- because we saw things on the screen
that we didn’t think were possible.
- משום שראינו דברים קורים על המסך
  שחשבנו שהם בלתי-אפשריים לביצוע.

49
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,280
- We saw these things, and our jaws just hit the floor, thinking
“Oh my God, you can do THAT with that program?”
- ראינו את הדברים האלה, והלסתות שלנו נשמטו לרצפה,
  וחשבנו: "אלוהים אדירים, אפשר לעשות את זה בתוכנה?!"

50
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:00,280
- This is what really moves us, motivates us, to find new
and impressive way of rendering graphics.
- זה מה שבאמת מניע אותנו: למצוא דרכים חדשות ומעניינות
  לרנדר (render, לצייר באמצעות מחשב) גרפיקה.

51
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
The similarities don’t end there.
הדמיון לא מסתיים כאן.

52
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,280
The birth and eventual popularity of the demoscene can be 
largely attributed to the appearance of computer games,
הסצינה חייבת את לידתה והפופולריות לה זכתה
להופעה בשוק של מחשקי מחשב,

53
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,400
the removal of their copy protection,
and their subsequent distribution.
התהליך של פריצתם (הסרת ההגנות מפני העתקה)
והפצתם לאחר פריצה מוצלחת.

54
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:27,120
- When people started cracking games on the C64 
twenty, twenty-five, almost thirty years ago,
- כשאנשים החלו לפרוץ משחקי מחשב על הקומודור
  64 לפני עשרים, עשרים-וחמש, כמעט שלושים שנה,

55
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:37,920
- after they were so happy after they cracked them that they 
left their names there, in the high score list, or in a graphic.
הם היו כל כך שמחים אחרי פריצה מוצלחת שהם השאירו
את שמם כחותמת, לפעמים ברשימת השיאים, או בגרפיקה.

56
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:45,080
- Then they realized that it's even cooler to
prepend a picture in front of the game, for example.
- ואז הם קלטו שזה אפילו יותר מגניב להוסיף למשחק
  קדימון, נאמר תמונה...

57
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,680
- They added text scrollers and greetings
and it got more and more complex.
- הם הוסיפו טקסט נגלל (scroller), ברכות
לחברים (greetings) וזה הלך ונהיה מורכב יותר ויותר.

58
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,960
- This is starting to sound a lot like graffiti to me.
- זה מתחיל להשמע מאוד כמו גרפיטי.

59
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,480
- Yeah, it’s similar, they sometimes I’ve heard
it said that the demoscene is “digital graffiti.”
- כן, יש דמיון, כבר יצא לי לשמוע אנשים מתארים
  את הסצינה כ"גרפיטי דיגיטלי".

60
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,960
- When someone cracked a game, they put little “intros” or 
“cracktros” in front of the game introducing the group,
- כשאדם או קבוצה פרצו משחק, הם היו שמים קדימונים (intros
  או cracktros) לפני המשחק כדי להציג את הקבוצה

61
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,320
- saying “We’re cool because we 
cracked this game and you didn’t.”
- כסוג של הצהרה: "אנחנו מגניבים כי
  פרצנו את המשחק הזה, ואתם לא."

62
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,400
- And then these groups formed, and the challenge
wasn’t just cracking the game anymore,
- ואז נוצרו עוד ועוד קבוצות כאלה, והאתגר
  כבר לא היה רק לפרוץ את המשחק,

63
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,320
- but also making better looking intros in front of the game.
- אלא גם ליצור קדימונים שנראים טוב יותר ויותר.

64
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,640
- People got to the point where they stopped caring
about the game and only watched the intros.
- בסופו של דבר הגיעה נקודה שבה לאנשים רבים
  כבר לא היה אכפת מהמשחק, והם רק צפו בקדימונים.

65
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:59,800
- And I was also one of those people! I liked the music a lot,
the fonts were cool, and they did some unbelievable things.
- ואני הייתי בדיוק כזה! אהבתי את המוסיקה, הגופנים
  (פונטים) היו מגניבים והם עשו דברים שקשה להאמין.

66
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,240
- Sometimes they were more technically
advanced than the game itself.
- לפעמים הקדימונים היו יותר מתקדמים-טכנית
  מהמשחק עצמו.

67
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
- Then there was a point where people
who were doing this started enjoying it so much
- ואז הגיעה נקודה נוספת בה האנשים שעסקו ביצירה
  גילו שהם כל-כך נהנים מהעניין,
  

68
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,960
- that they decided they didn’t need 
games anymore, just the intros.
- שהם החליטו שלא צריך את המשחקים יותר.
  רק את הקדימונים.

69
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
- That was the moment the demoscene was born.
- זה היה הרגע בו נולדה סצינת הדמואים.

70
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:38,880
- If you had a computer, that was already an elite thing,
and you had to meet other people who had computers;
- אם היה לך מחשב, זה כבר היה סמל סטטוס,
  ופשוט רצית לפגוש אנשים נוספים עם מחשבים;

71
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,840
- the thrill came from creating things with the computer,
instead of just playing games.
- ההרפתקה וההסיפוק באו מליצור דברים באמצעות
  המחשב, ולא רק לשחק משחקים כל הזמן.

72
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,040
- That’s why the demoscene was able to take shape.
- לולא ההתלהבות הזו, הסצינה לא הייתה מתהווה.

‏Slyspy‪.‬ מוסיקאי, גרפיקאי, חבר בקבוצת United Force.

74
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
Has quite possibly written more music
than any other Hungarian scener,
כתב ככל הנראה יותר מוסיקה מכל חבר אחר בסצינה ההונגרית,

75
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,000
and has recently gained popularity outside Hungary
after he started making his own demos and animations.
ולאחרונה זוכה לפופולריות מחוץ להונגריה לאחר שהחל
ליצור דמואים ואנימציות משלו.

76
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,880
- We met at the 'Csoki', the Csokonay Community House,
- נפגשנו ב"צ'וקי", המתנ"ס המקומי,

77
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,360
- that was the center of the Hungarian 
computer culture, the weekend club.
‫-‬ שהיה המרכז של תרבות המיחשוב ההונגרית,
  מועדון סוף השבוע.

78
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,240
- That was where I first saw demos on the C64,
and I immediately took a liking to them.
‫-‬ שם ראיתי לראשונה דמואים על הקומודור 64,
  והתאהבתי מיד.

79
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,240
- For a few years I was just interested,
then as groups started forming,
‫-‬ למשך כמה שנים הייתי רק סקרן,
  ואז כשהחלו לקום קבוצות דמואים...

80
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,080
- I slowly got involved in it 
like other people doing these things.
‫-‬ התחלתי להיות מעורב לאט לאט,
  כמו אנשים אחרים שעסקו בזה.

81
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,600
In the last 30 years, the demoscene, 
having evolved from cracktros,
בשלושים השנים האחרונות, הסצינה שהתפתחה מאותם
קדימונים (cracktros),

82
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,320
as well as computer science itself, 
has gone through radical changes. 
כמו גם מדעי המחשב עצמם, עברה מהפכות משמעותיות.

83
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Over time, the tools, the limits, 
and the purpose have all changed.
לאורך הזמן הכלים, הגבולות והייעדים - כולם השתנו.

84
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:55,160
- Back then it all revolved around coding, exploiting tight 
hardware limitations, like on an 8-bit C64 or an Amiga.
‫-‬ בזמנו הכל סבב סביב תכנות, לנצל את יכולות המכונה
  עד תום, על מחשבי 8-ביט כמו הקומודור 64, ועל האמיגה.

85
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,080
- In those days the attitude was 
“we’ll prove that we’re the best.”
- בימים ההם הגישה הייתה להוכיח שאתה הטוב היותר.

86
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,080
- World records were easy to measure, because 
like the C64, all the computers had the same capabilities.
‫-‬ היה קל מאוד למדוד שיאים שונים, משום שלמחשבים
  כמו קומודור 64 היו בדיוק אותן יכולות.

87
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:15,160
- So they went for world records for drawing the 
most sine-dots or largest number of wavy scrollers.
‫-‬ אז קבוצות הדמואים התחרו על דברים כמו לצייר גל סינוס
  עם הכי הרבה נקודות, או הכי הרבה scrollerים בו-זמנית.

88
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,520
- And if someone could drew 250 dots,
but his neighbor was able to draw 253,
‫-‬ ואז אם מישהו יכל לשים על המסך 250 נקודות בו-זמנית,
  אבל השכן שלו הצליח לצייר 253,

89
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,640
- it escalated into a 48-hour caffeine marathon 
to figure out how to draw 257.
‫-‬ זה הסלים למרתונים רווי-קפה של 48 שעות בניסיון
  לצייר 257.

90
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,200
- The limits are broader now, so it’s more about design.
‫-‬ המחשבים חזקים יותר כיום, הגבולות רחבים בהרבה
  אז עכשיו התחרות היא יוצר על עיצוב אמנותי.

91
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,280
- Demos try to be unique artistically, but still,
the demos that gain the most respect are the ones
‫-‬ דמואים מנסים להיות ייחודיים אמנותית, אך
  גם היום הדמואים שזוכים להכי הרבה כבוד

92
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:53,200
- that are exciting both codewise
- by pushing limitations - and also artistically.
‫-‬ הם אלה שמרשימים מבחינת התכנות - ע"י פריצת
  הגבולות - אך לא מחפפים אמנותית.

93
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,760
- The point is to present a product
that makes people sh*t themselves!
‫-‬ הפואנטה היא להציג "מוצר" שיגרום לאנשים
  לחרבן במכנסיים!

94
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,560
Of course, this is the easiest to achieve when the 
audience knows the limitations of that given computer,
הכי כל להשיג מטרה זאת, כמובן, כאשר
הקהל מכיר את המגבלות של מחשב נתון,

95
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,800
and is aware of the technical possibilities.
ומודע למה ניתן לעשות איתו טכנית.

96
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Naive observers may not be 
astonished by a rotating cube,
ייתכן שלצופה מהצד לא ברור מה מרשים מקובייה מסתובבת,

97
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,760
even though perhaps even the engineers creating the computer 
wouldn't have thought that to be possible on the system in question.
אך ייתכן בהחלט שהמהנדסים שתכננו ובנו את המחשב
לא חשבו שזה בכלל יהיה אפשרו על המכונה שלהם.

98
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,840
As limitations expanded, it has become 
possible to create spectacular demos
עם התרחבות הגבולות של מה שניתן לבצע עם מכונה,
נהיה אפשרי ליצור דמואים מרהיבים חזותית,

99
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,960
that can be enjoyed without a particular technical knowledge. 
שניתן להינות מהם ללא שום ידע טכני מוקדם.

100
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,520
This can also be attributed to a change in artistic perspective.
ניתן לייחס זאת גם לשינוי בנקודת מבט אמנותית.

101
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:47,560
- Nowadays the roles are more diffuse, demos and intros
usually have a sort of a producer or director
‫-‬ כיום התפקידים (של חברי הקבוצה) יותר מגוונים;
  לדמואים יש בדרך כלל סוג של מפיק או במאי,

102
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:55,840
- who has a vision for the final big picture,
and they’re the ones trying to manage the workflow.
‫-‬ להם יש חזון ברור ל"תמונה הגדולה", והם אלה
  שמכוונים ומנסים לנהל את תהליך העבודה.

103
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
- The director.
- Yeah, the director.
‫-‬ הבמאי.
- כן, הבמאי.

104
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,720
- Some demos are purely about technology,
“Look, I made a cool effect, whoa, great.”
‫-‬ יש דמואים שהם לגמרי טכניים: "תראו,
  עשיתי אפקט חדש מגניב."

105
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:12,280
- Some don’t use much new technology,
but they look great, and that’s their point.
‫-‬ חלקם לא מחדשים הרבה טכנית, אך הם
  נראים נהדר, וזו מטרתם.

106
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:20,480
- And there are some which, well,
try to convey some kind of message.
‫-‬ ויש דמואים שמנסים, ובכן, מנסים להעביר
  מסר כלשהוא.

107
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:29,120
On Tuesday, I realized that I help people
sell other people stuff they don’t really need.
ביום שלישי הבנתי שאני עוזר לאנשים למכור
דברים שהם לא צריכים לאנשים אחריםץ

108
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,360
This happened during lunch.
זה קרה במהלך ארוחת הצהריים.

109
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,960
- It’s become harder to appreciate demos that 
only display a cube or a good looking 3D scene
‫-‬ נהיה קשה יותר ויותר להעריך דמואים שרק
  מציגים קוביה או סצנה תלת-ממדית שנראית טוב.

110
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,320
- even if it looks good, it needs to have 
a concept to really be appreciated.
‫-‬ אפילו אם זה נראה מצויין, צריך להיות שם
  איזהשהו רעיון מנחה (קונספט) כדי להיות מוערך.

111
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,440
Gargaj. Coder, musician, member of 
Conspiracy and Ümlaüt Design.
‏Gargaj. מתכנת, מוסיקאי, חבר בקבוצות Conspiracy
ו-Ümlaüt Design.

112
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,720
Main organizer of the Function demoparty,
actively takes part in a variety of foreign events.
המארגן הראשי של מסיבת הדמואים Function,
לוקח חלק פעיל במגוון ארועים בינלאומיים.

113
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,400
- A part of the thing that the United States doesn’t
often see about the demoscene is how social it is.
‫-‬ חלק מהותי בסצינה שהרבה פעמים לא רואים בארה"ב
  הוא שהסצינה היא ביסודה מאוד חברתית.

114
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,160
- It’s a very social thing.
‫-‬ זו תופעה חברתית במהותה.

115
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,160
The small community of the scene itself is as important 
to keep the creation process alive as the artists themselves.
הקהילה הקטנה של סצינת הדמואים חיונית להמשכיות
היצירה בדיוק כמו האמנים עצמם.

116
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,400
The communal event of the subculture
itself is called the demoparty,
הארוע החברתי של הסצינה עצמה נקרא
מסיבת דמואים (demoparty),

117
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,960
a computer-related event where fans of the scene compare 
their skills, exchange experiences and ideas, and socialize.
ארוע מחשוב בו חברי הסצינה ומשוגעים לדבר משווים
את יכולותיהם, מחליפים חוויות ורעיונות, ומתיידדים.

118
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,760
Productions are entered in a variety of categories and 
ultimately they’re subjected to a final audience vote. 
יצירות מתחרות במגוון קטגוריות, ולבסוף הקהל
הוא זה שמצביע על היצירות המוצלחות ביותר.

119
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,440
In essence, these parties keep the demoscene running.
המסיבות הן אלה ששומרות על הסצינה חיה ובועטת.

120
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,320
- Very few people do productions “just for kicks”,
to release them on some website;
‫-‬ מעט מאוד אנשים יוצרים "סתם בשביל הכיף,"
  ומשחררים את היצירות שלהם על איזה אתר אינטרנט;

121
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,200
- the idea is usually to enter a competition at a party,
and to see it on the bigscreen and hear it on the PA, 
‫-‬ הרצון הוא בדרך כלל להירשם לתחרות באחת המסיבות,
  לראות ולשמוע את היצירה שלך על המסך הגדול,

122
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,240
- and the audience either likes it or it doesn’t,
but at least it has an effect on them.
‫-‬ והקהל אוהב את היצירה שלך או שלא,
  אבל לפחות יש לה השפעה כלשהיא.

123
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,560
- We are a bunch of opinionated people
who like to see people make things.
‫-‬ אנחנו חבורה של אנשים דעתניים,
  שאוהבים לראות אנשים בונים ויוצרים.

124
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,840
- Seeing your work on a bigscreen, being watched and applauded 
by two hundred people, there’s nothing better than that!
‫-‬ כשהיצירה שלך מוצגת, נצפית ומקבלת מחיאות כפיים
  מכמה מאות אנשים… אין דבר טוב מזה!

125
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,400
- Some people like to release demos to
for the challenge of beating other teams.
‫-‬ יש אנשים שאוהבים ליצור דמואים למען האתגר
  שבלנצח קבוצות אחרות.

126
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,760
- Some people enjoy just competing.
‫-‬ יש אנשים שפחות אוהבים להתחרות.

127
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,600
- Some people enjoy going to the competitions and entering 
something that they know other people are going to hate.
‫-‬ יש אנשים שאוהבים לרשום לתחרויות יצירות שהם
  יודעים שאנשים אחרים ישנאו.

128
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,120
The roots of demoparties reach back to the 80’s,
השורשים של מסיבות הדמואים נעוצים אי שם בשנות השמונים,

129
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,040
and their existence can also be owed
to illegally cracked and distributed games.
וגם הן קיימות הודות לפריצה והפצה בלתי-חוקית של
משחקי מחשב.

130
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,040
- These parties were originally copyparties,
people came together to copy stuff. 
- המסיבות האלה היו במקורן "מסיבות העתקה,"
  אנשים באו כדי להעתיק משחקים ותוכנות זה מזה.

131
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,320
- You mean you couldn’t just steal stuff
‫-‬ אתה מתכוון שלא יכלת סתם לגנוב דברים?

132
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,400
- Sure you could, but you had no Internet back then,
and besides postal mail,
‫-‬ ודאי שיכלת, אבל הרשת (אינטרנט) לא הייתה
  קיימת בזמנו, ולכן חוץ מדואר רגיל,

133
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,880
- the easiest method was to just drop by 
your neighbour’s and copy a floppy.
- הדרך הקלה ביותר הייתה פשוט לקפוץ לשכן
  ולהעתיק דיסקט.

134
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
- And if you had more than forty 'neighbours', 
you rented out a hall.
‫-‬ ואם היו לך יותר מארבעים "שכנים" כאלה,
  שכרת אולם.

135
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,240
- They came together, they copied stuff,
and eventually demos appeared,
‫-‬ אנשים באו, העתיקו דברים זה מזה,
  והדמואים בסופו של דבר נכנסו לתמונה,

136
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,800
- because some people were just 
interested in making intros.
‫-‬ כי חלק מהאנשים היו פשוט מעוניינים
  בליצור אותם.

137
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:48,200
- Currently there’s only one party here in Hungary 
that’s a multiplatform, 'PC' party, and there’s also an 8-bit one.
‫-‬ כיום יש רק מסיבה אחת שמתקיימת כאן בהונגריה לכל
  פלטפורמות המחשוב, ויש גם אחת למחשבי 8-ביט בלבד.

138
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,440
- There aren’t any serious prizes here, so it’s more about,
I don’t know, the moral victory, the experience itself.
‫-‬ הפרסים למנצחים אינם רציניים במיוחד, אז זה יותר,
  לא יודע, ניצחון רוחני, החוויה עצמה.

139
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,400
Function is currently the biggest 
Hungarian multi-platform demoscene party,
‏Function היא ככל הנראה מסיבת הדמואים הגדולה
ביותר בהונגריה למגוון פלטפורמות מחשוב,

140
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,400
hosting 150-200 enthusiasts annually since 2003.
ומבקרים בה 150-200 משוגעים לדבר כל שנה מאז 2003.

141
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,480
About a quarter of them participate
in the competitions as well.
כרבע מהם גם משתתף בתחרויות.

142
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:20,600
- The hard core was always around 100-200 people, and that has 
since shrunk to 50-60, so we know each other pretty well by now.
‫-‬ הגרעין הקשה תמיד היה סביב 150-200 איש, ומאז התכווץ
  ל-50-60 איש, כך שאנחנו מכירים אחד את השני טוב למדי.

143
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,640
- What do you expect from this kind of party?
‫-‬ למה אתה מצפה מסוג כזה של מסיבה?

144
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,560
- Do you expect good demos, or do you expect the community 
to show up? Is there a specific goal, or is it just 'there'?
‫-‬ אתה מצפה לדמואים טובים, או שאתה מצפה שהקהילה
  תופיע? יש מטרה מסויימת, או שזה מתקיים "סתם כך"?

145
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:37,600
- We expect people to show up, enjoy themselves,
and bring great productions.
‫-‬ אנחנו מצפים מאנשים להופיע, להינות
  ולהביא איתם יצירות מעולות,

146
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,080
- I couldn’t rank these things.
‫-‬ לאו דווקא בסדר הזה.

147
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,720
- All I know is when a party ends and you look around
at those 100-150-200 people who showed up 
‫-‬ כל מה שאני יודע זה שכשהמסיבה מסתיימת, אתה
  מסתכל מסביבך ורואה את אותם 150 או 200 איש -

148
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,880
- because that’s the size of Hungarian parties - 
‫-‬ זה הגודל של המסיבות בהונגריה -

149
00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:00,560
- then you just instinctively know that you have to
do it again next year, period. I can’t explain why.
‫-‬ אתה יודע מתוך דחף טבעי שאתה חייב לעשות את זה
  שוב בשנה הבאה, נקודה. אני לא יכול להסביר למה.

150
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:08,280
- It’s about seeing happy people. Whether they’re happy
because they saw great demos they never saw before,
‫-‬ זה הכל במטרה לראות אנשים שמחים. בין אם בגלל
  שהם ראו דמואים מעולים חדשים,

151
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:18,680
- or because they started chatting with someone next to them 
and now they’re swapping sources and they got something to use later,
‫-‬ או בגלל שהם התחילו לדבר עם מישהו שעמד לידם
  ועכשיו הם מחליפים קוד מכונה (source) לשימוש בהמשך,

152
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,520
- or because they experienced that atmosphere
when the organizers announce the start of the compo, 
‫-‬ או בגלל שהם חוו את האווירה המיוחדת הזו כשהמארגנים
  הודיעו על תחילתה של תחרות,

153
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,960
- and shut off the lights, and the first entry appears, 
and they got shivers 
‫-‬ ואז כבו האורות והיצירה הראשונה מופיעה על המסך,
  והם קיבלו צמרמורת...

154
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,720
- All of these things happened to me when I started to go to parties, 
and I couldn’t just pick one of them,
‫-‬ כל הדברים האלה קרו לי כשהתחלתי ללכת למסיבות
  דמואים, ולא הייתי יכול לבחור אחד מתוכם.

155
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:48,480
- all I know is that when I came back from my first party, 
I thought “Yup, that was it, I’m sold, I gotta go to more of these”.
‫-‬ אני יכול רק לומר שכשחזרתי מהמסיבה הראשונה שלו,
  חשבתי לעצמי "כן, אני מכור, חייב ללכת לעוד כאלה."

156
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,720
- I was wondering whether it’s worth it to organize parties.
I mean you don’t really get sponsors,
‫-‬ תהיתי אם זה כְּדָאִי לארגן מסיבות דמואים.
  אני מתכוון, אין לכם באמת נותני חסות,

157
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,440
- there are no products to sell, so it’s only organized for fun
and for the purpose of meeting up, right?
‫-‬ אין מוצרים למכור, אז הכל מאורגן בשביל הכיף
  וכדי להיפגש, נכון?

158
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,120
- Financially, it’s not worth it. 
‫-‬ מבחינה כלכלית, זה לא שווה את זה.

159
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:12,320
- We don’t get state funding, because what we do
isn’t considered to be art or culture.
‫-‬ אנו לא מקבלים מימון מהמדינה, כי מה שאנחנו עוסקים
  בו לא נחשב לאמנות או אירוע תרבות.

160
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,560
-We don’t do this because it’s worth it or not.
‫-‬ כדאיות אינה שיקול כאן.

161
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,920
- Sometimes people do things they know that aren’t worth it,
but they do it because they know they have to.
‫-‬ לפעמים אנשים עושים דברים שאינם כדאיים, אך הם
  עושים אותם בכל זאת כי הם חייבים זאת לעצמם.

162
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,200
- We have a lot of returning foreign visitors. 
‫-‬ יש לנו הרבה מבקרים מחו"ל שחוזרים שנה אחרי שנה.

163
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,720
- They not only show up to check where 'Bucharest' is,
but because they’ve already been here and enjoyed it.
‫-‬ הם לא מגיעים רק כדי לבדוק איפה זה בודפשט,
  אלא כי הם כבר היו כאן ונהנו מזה.

164
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,440
Arles. A small town in Southern France, not far from Marseille.
ארל. עיירה קטנה בדרום צרפת, לא רחוק ממרסיי.

165
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,480
It’s popular among visitors due to
it’s authentic Mediterranean old town, 
יעד פופולרי לתיירים בגלל שנמצאת בה עיר עתיקה
ים-תיכונית אותנטית,

166
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,880
but in October, people are attracted for a different reason. 
אך בחודש אוקטובר אנשים נמשכים אליה מסיבות אחרות.

167
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,840
In recent years, Arles hosted one of 
France’s best known parties, MAIN,
בשנים האחרונות, ארל אירחה את אחת ממסיבות הדמואים
המוכרות ביותר בצרפת, Main,

168
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
partly organized by Hungarians.
שרבים ממארגניה הונגרים.

169
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,520
- We organized a party in Hungary, and on the last two occasions, 
the foreigners were watching the videostream over the Internet
‫-‬ ארגנו מסיבת דמואים בהונגריה, ובפעמיים האחרונות אנשים
  רבים מחו"ל צפו בה בהזרמת וידאו (streaming) באינטרנט,

170
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,000
- and later asked for our help with organizing their party.
‫-‬ ולאחר מכן ביקשו מאיתנו עזרה בארגון המסיבה שלהם.

171
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
Pasy. Coder, organizer, member of 
Fresh!Mindworkz and Rebels.
‏Pasy. מתכנת, אמרגן, חבר בקבוצות Fresh‪!‬Mindworkz ו-Rebels.

172
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
Has quite possibly coded more demos 
than any other Hungarian scener.
תכנת ככל הנראה יותר דמואים מכל חבר-סצינה הונגרי אחר.

173
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
Technical lead organizer of the Main party in France.
האמרגן הטכני הראשי של מסיבת Main בצרפת.

174
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,320
- First it was only me travelling to a meeting, 
later I collected a team,
- בהתחלה זה היה רק אני שנסעתי לפגישות,
  ומאוחר יותר אספתי סביבי צוות,

175
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,000
- and eventually the entire technical team 
ended up being Hungarians.
‫-‬ וכך יצא שבסופו של דבר כל חברי צוות
  המארגנים הטכני הם הונגרים.

176
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,320
- French organizers are much better with financial
and political organizing, keeping contacts, that sort of stuff.
‫-‬ המארגנים הצרפתים טובים בהרבה בארגון כלכלי
  ופוליטי, יחסי-ציבור ודברים כאלה.

177
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,800
There are many similarities between Hungarian and foreign 
parties, but there are plenty of differences as well,
יש הרבה דמיון בין המסיבות ההונגריות ואלה מחוץ
להונגריה, אך גם הרבה הבדלים,

178
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,400
not necessarily limited to the giant display
mounted on the roof of the party hall,
הכוללים בין היתר את מסך התצוגה הענק
המוצב על גג ההיכל,

179
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,120
which incidentally provides a competition platform
for a variety of productions as well.
שמשמש כפלטפורמה למגוון תחרויות ויצירות.

180
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,920
- The budget for a Hungarian party is the amount
they spend on two or three people here.
- התקציב הכולל למסיבה בהונגריה זעום, שווה
  ערך לתקציב עבור שניים-שלושה משתתפים בלבד פה.

181
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,920
- The heads of the association are 
really good at finding sponsors,
‫-‬ המארגנים הראשיים מעולים במציאת נותני-חסות,

182
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,360
- and art is curated a lot more here in France,
it doesn’t matter what kind of art it is.
‫-‬ ואמנות זוכה להרבה יותר תשומת לב מהממשלה והקהל
  הרחב בצרפת, לא משנה באיזה סוג אמנות מדובר.

183
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,440
The demoscene is one of the few forms of art
where the artists are all part of one collective.
סצינת הדמואים היא אחד מסוגי האמנות היחידים
בהם האמנים כולם מתפקדים כחברים בהתאגדות אחת.

184
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,040
It’d be hard to imagine multiple, independent 
communities or outlets of expression
קשה לדמיין מספר קהילות עצמאיות, 

185
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,040
or that someone would create demos while detached
from the main community, publishing works in different places.
או שמישהו ייצור דמו בנפרד מהקהילה הראשית,
ויפרסמם במקומות אחרים.

186
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,040
- If people stop making parties, demoscene will die.
‫-‬ אם אנשים יפסיקו לארגן מסיבות דמואים,
  הסצינה תגווע ותמות.

187
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,320
- Because you need real contact in real life
with people you make demos with,
‫-‬ צריך קשר בחיים האמיתיים עם החברים
  שיוצרים עימם דמואים,

188
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,320
- and you meet with to talk, 
even it is just once-twice a year.
‫-‬ וחייבים להיפגש ולדבר - אפילו אם זה
  רק פעם או פעמיים בשנה.

189
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,000
- You feel the demoscene when 
you are talking with the people.
- אתה מרגיש את הסצינה כשאתה מדבר עם אנשים.

190
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,520
- It has happened that a demo was 
played for which I have written the music,
‫-‬ קרה פעם שכתבתי מוסיקה לדמו, ואחרי שהוצג

191
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,520
- and someone walked up and asked
whether I used a certain instrument or a certain synth,
‫-‬ ניגש אליי מישהו ושאל אם השתמשתי בכלי נגינה
  או סינטיסייזר מסויים,

192
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,760
- and we started talking and we’ve become friends.
‫-‬ התחלנו לדבר ונהיינו חברים טובים.

193
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,560
- Our biggest rivals are also our best friends, 
I’m happy to say that.
‫-‬ אני שמח לומר שהמתחרים הגדולים ביותר שלנו
  הם גם החברים הכי טובים.

194
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,760
Parties are of course not only about the competitions,
but also about gaining experience and having fun.
מסיבות הדמואים לא סובבות אך ורק את התחרויות,
אלא גם נותנות הזדמנות לצבור ניסיון ופשוט לעשות חיים.

195
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Aside from technical lectures, the schedules often
consist of scene-related live acts or bands,
חוץ מהרצאות טכניות, לוח הזמנים של המסיבות כולל
לרוב מופעים חיים והופעות מוסיקליות שקשורות לסצינה,

196
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,960
and in several cases, a demoparty has become
memorable not only because of the demos shown,
ובמקרים אחדים המסיבה נהייתה ידועה לא בגלל
שהוצגו בה דמואים מרשימים במיוחד,

197
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,320
but because of the actual party itself.
כי אם בגלל המסיבה עצמה.

198
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,560
- At Polish parties it has happened that the
organizing team was already drunk on the first day
‫-‬ במסיבות בפולין כבר קרה בעבר שכל צוות המארגנים
  השתכר לחלוטין כבר ביום הראשון,

199
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,120
- and people are arriving, trying to find the party
‫-‬ עוד ועוד אנשים הגיעו וניסו למצוא את המסיבה,

200
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,560
- Finns just sit around drinking vodka 
straight from the bottle
‫-‬ פינים ישבו מסביב ושתו וודקה ישר מהבקבוק,

201
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,320
- and then someone walks up to 
pee on someone else’s bicycle.
‫-‬ ופתאום מישהו ניגש והשתין על האופניים של מישוה אחר.

202
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
- There haven’t been any deaths though. 
No deaths and no births.
‫-‬ אך לעולם לא מת אף אחד - לא היו מיתות
  ולא היו לידות.

203
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,440
- I’d like to know how it feels to be female in the scene,
‘cos it seems like a boys’ club.
‫-‬ הייתי רוצה לדעת איך זה להיות בחורה שחברה בסצינה,
  כי זה הרבה פעמים מרגיש כמו מועדון לבנים בלבד.

204
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,640
- Is it easy to find friends? ‘Cos it’s mostly males.
‫-‬ קל למצוא חברים? כי כמעט כולם גברים.

205
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:43,480
- Sure, it’s not that hard. Of course everyone have
their own little theories about how it works.
‫-‬ בטח, זה לא כזה קשה. כמובן שלכולם יש תאוריות
  לגבי איך זה עובד.

206
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,320
- When I started, there were already a few girls in 
the scene all around Europe and in Hungary as well.
‫-‬ כשהתחלתי בסצינה לראשונה כבר היו כמה בחורות
  בסצינה ברחבי אירופה, ובהונגריה בפרט.

207
00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:01,400
- You had musicians, graphics artists, coders,
a lot of visitors, tagging along with their boyfriends.
‫-‬ היו מוסיקאיות, גרפיקאיות, מתכנתות, והרבה מבקרות
  שהגיעו עם החברים שלהן.

208
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:11,240
- I don’t know about activity,
I’d guess it’s around 90/10, no? Or 80/20?
‫-‬ ומה לגבי פעילות, הייתי מנחש שהיחס הוא 90/10?
  או אולי 80/20?

209
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,400
- I’d say 80/20.
‫-‬ הייתי אומרת 80/20.

210
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,040
Demos aren’t the only things to compete at parties:
דמואים אינם הדברים היחידים עליהם מתחרים במסיבות;

211
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,280
other categories include pictures, music, standalone pieces 
of code, even photos and miscellaneous other productions.
בין יתר הקטגוריות ניתן למצוא ציור, מוסיקה, חתיכות קוד
מבודדות, אפילו צילום וכל מני סוגי יצירה אחרים.

212
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,040
They do have one thing in common though:
They’re mostly finished just before the deadline.
אך לכל היצירות דבר אחד במשותף: כמעט את
כולן מסיימים רק דקות לפני הדדליין.

213
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,400
- Everyone has way too little time to make demos,
so things are left to the last minute.
‫-‬ לכולם יש מעט מדי זמן לעשות דמואים,
  אז דברים נותרים לרגע האחרון.

214
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,400
- You usually go without sleep for the last few days,
only concentrating on your demo. 
‫-‬ בדרך כלל מעבירים את כמה הימים לפני המסיבה
  ללא שינה, ומתרכזים רק בלסיים את הדמו.

215
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:50,160
- That usually manifests as flaws and little imperfections,
because they’re literally finished at the last minute,
‫-‬ זה בא לידי ביטוי לעתים קרובות בפגמים ואי-שלמויות קטנות,
  כיוון שכמעט תמיד עובדים על היצירה ממש עד הרגע האחרון,

216
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,320
- but this also provides a thrill that keeps people going.
‫-‬ אבל זה מספק סוג מסויים של
  ריגוש שגורם לאנשים להמשיך.

217
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,240
- So in a sense it’s like a mental extreme sport.
‫-‬ אז מבחינה מסויימת זה כמו ספורט אקסטרים למוח.

218
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:08,120
- Sometimes it happens that the demo is finished at the party.
-Yes, I heard that somebody is finishing at the last moment.
‫-‬ לפעמים קורה שמסיימים את הדמו במסיבה עצמה.
- כן, שמעתי שמישהו מסיים ממש בשנייה האחרונה.

219
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,600
- Someone is finishing the demo
- It’s not like that, it’s not perfect, it’s not perfect.
‫-‬ מישהו מסיים את הדמו?
- זה לא ככה, זה לא מושלם, זה אף פעם לא מושלם.

220
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,400
- No, when I was leaving home, it still crashed at 
the begining, there is still a few major flaws to be fixed.
‫-‬ לא, כשעזבתי את הבית זה עדיין קרס על ההתחלה,
  ועדיין יש הרבה בעיות מהותיות שצריך לתקן.

221
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,600
- It’s a whole different feeling to go to a party
and have something to enter than to just attend
‫-‬ זו הרגשה שונה לגמרי להגיע למסיבת דמואים כדי
  להשתתף בתחרויות מאשר סתם להגיע כדי להיות כאן.

222
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,160
- It’s a whole different feeling to go to a party
knowing you’re gonna spend the entire party in a corner
‫-‬ זו הרגשה שונה לגמרי ללכת למסיבה כשאתה יודע
  שתבלה את כולה באיזו פינה,

223
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,280
- in front of a laptop trying to hack something together.
‫-‬ יושב מול המחשב שלך כדי לנסות ולקמבן משהו עובד.

224
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,480
- Yeah, it has happened, 
even if it wasn’t the entire party.
‫-‬ כן, זה קרה לי בעבר, גם אם לא לאורך כל המסיבה.

225
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,960
- But that has it’s charm too, sitting there working 
on something, people come up, take a listen, take a look
‫-‬ אבל יש לזה קסם משלו, לשבת שם ולעבוד על משהו,
  וכל פעם מישהו עוצר כדי להקשיב או לראות...

226
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,320
- You can look up, check out someone else working
‫-‬ אתה מסתכל מסביב לרגע ורואה מישהו אחר עובד
  על משהו, בדיוק כמוך,

227
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,000
- You can ask for advice from other musicians, if you’re 
working on music, or from other coders if you’re a coder.
‫-‬ אתה יכול לבקש עצות ממוסיקאים אחרים אם אתה
  עובד על מוסיקה, או מתכנתים אחרים אם אתה מתכנת.

228
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,720
- Yeah, if it crashes you just yell over,
“Hey, could you check this out for me?”
‫-‬ כן, אם זה קורס אתה יכול פשוט לצעוק לחלל החדר,
  "מישהו יכול לבוא לעזור לי להבין מה קורה פה?"

229
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,600
- And you end up with three people debugging it.
‫-‬ ולמצוא את עצמך עם שלושה אנשים שונים שמדבגים
‏  (debugging, פתרון בעיות בתוכנה) את אותה בעיה.

230
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,840
- What’s the minimum amount of time 
needed to make a demo?
‫-‬ מה הזמן המינימלי הדרוש כדי ליצור דמו?

231
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,720
- 90 minutes.
‫-‬ 90 דקות.

232
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,040
- Yeah, it can be anything 
from 90 minutes to several years.
‫-‬ כן, זה יכול להיות כל זמן בין 90 דקות לכמה שנים.

233
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,800
As the evolution of computer science started expanding the 
technical borders, a demand for artificial limitations became clear.

234
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,440
This is how size-limited demos, or 'intros', came to be.

235
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:44,320
The point of these is that the final executable file isn’t allowed 
to exceed the given sizelimitation, for example 4 or 64 kilobytes.

236
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,840
- My classmate brought me these files on a floppy, saying

237
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,280
- “check this out, you’re not gonna believe
what this is gonna show you in 64 kilobytes!”

238
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:04,160
- You have an executable file, you run it, you get four minutes 
of music video, and it’s so amazing it blows your mind.

239
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
- Pounding techno music.
- Yeah!

240
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,400
- You see a 4 kilobyte intro, showing off
a shocking amount of high-quality visuals,

241
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,120
- and you can’t even fathom how much 4 kilobytes are: 

242
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,480
- You start writing something in Wordpad
and you go over 4 kilobytes very fast.

243
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,120
- Get your... let’s say CV in the Microsoft Word.
Your CV is already three times bigger that this intro.

244
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,120
To store one letter, or one character, 
you need one byte of space.

245
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,400
4 kilobytes of space means 4096 characters.
That’s little more than a page of text.

246
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,800
That’s the maximum amount of data 
a 4 kilobyte intro can consist of.

247
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,040
Running such a program, however, can allow the 
computer to generate 5 minutes of visuals and music

248
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
in full HD resolution, in realtime. 
Like this one.

249
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,120
- When you are limiting yourself to a very tight size, 
like 4 kbytes or 64 kbytes,

250
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:30,440
- you really need to use not-so-usual ways of drawing to 
the screen, or getting sound out of the speakers.

251
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,880
While 64 kilobyte intros can store 16 times
the information of 4 kilobyte ones,

252
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,120
they’re still considerably smaller
than content stored the traditional way.

253
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,680
Normally, 64 kilobyte space allows one to store about 4 seconds
of average quality MP3, or about half a second of video.

254
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,280
- You watch a five minute video, it blows your mind
because it’s so awesome and ultimately it turns out

255
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,480
- that the file would fit ten thousand times 
on a DVD or CD.

256
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,880
- If you rendered it to video, 
it would only fit three times. 

257
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,720
Some people think even 4 kilobytes of space is too much.

258
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,560
This is why we can encounter productions and
competitions for 256 or even 128 byte intros, 

259
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,120
where the limitation is merely this amount of characters. 
Nowadays, these usually consist of short animations without sound.

260
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,800
- We saw 3D visuals in 128 bytes.

261
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:50,680
- Jaws dropping everywhere, screaming ovation, everything. 
And then they showed the bytecode on the bigscreen in a hex editor.

262
00:30:50,680 --> 00:31:01,480
- “This is it.” And we applauded the code, because we
couldn’t believe that someone did it with only that.

263
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:09,640
- We feel the need for the limitation, 
you know, to feel more creative.

264
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,040
Just as artists strive to conquer artificial
limitations on modern computers,

265
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,360
people who write demos for retro computers are driven to 
explore technical limitations in the most profound ways possible.

266
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,480
Commodore 64, Plus 4, ZX Spectrum, Amiga.

267
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,640
Computers long out of production, sometimes with
technologies and barriers from 30 years ago,

268
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,040
and yet they continue to be utilized to present
more and more unbelievable things from time to time.

269
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Their popularity is best demonstrated by the fact that the 
C64 can still claim to have the most productions ever released,

270
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,000
having over 18000 compared to about 14000 on the PC.

271
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
- There’s a smaller group of people 
who love these computers,

272
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,560
- and perhaps they don’t even care about other machines,
because they have their own demoscene turf.

273
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:27,000
- Back when there were more sceners,
there was this less-than-serious rivalry thing.

274
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,400
- It was a bit exaggerated, C64 users versus PC users,
especially Amiga users versus PC users

275
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,120
- You know, kinda like Depeche Mode fans
versus Cure fans, and so on.

276
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,360
Reptile. Started as a musician, later worked as a coder. 

277
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,920
Member of Astroidea, with whom
he has won a variety of competitions.

278
00:32:51,600 --> 00:33:00,440
- The Amiga was a computer way ahead of it’s time. 
It was an incredibly well built machine, very imaginative.

279
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,720
- And for a lot of people, the PC hurt because they
considered it a step back in many ways.

280
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,080
- The Amiga wasn’t a computer for the masses! That was the 
point, it was like the Harley-Davidson, it had an elegance to it.

281
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,640
- And then the PC came along, the mass-market 
machine, plastic junk with interchangable parts.

282
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,720
- Businesswise, this was obviously a better model,

283
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:35,480
- but the elegance of the Amiga created a really strict culture
around it; people would kill for what the Amiga means for them.

284
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,960
Ajkarendek. A small ordinary village in western Hungary.
Streets are quiet, people are nice.

285
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Once a year, however, something changes.

286
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,240
Every summer the town is flooded
with fans of 8-bit computers for 3 days,

287
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,720
who are there to take part in Árok Party, an event
that’s been running for almost fifteen years now.

288
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:31,760
- Árok Party is THE genuine party for the C64
and other 8-bit computers in Hungary.

289
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:41,440
- Initially we made it a strictly demoscene event, that was the 
intention, but then we realized there are more people interested.

290
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,080
- Others showed up, some made hardware, 
others just played games. 

291
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,640
Poison. Graphics artist, member of Singular Crew.

292
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,960
One of the main organizers of the 15-year-old Árok Party.

293
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,160
- It’s one of those parties which are mostly about friendship,
despite the common heritage these people have.

294
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,080
- A lot of veterans show up to hang out,
when we meet every summer.

295
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:15,280
- There’s been years with almost a hundred people, some of 
them Czech, some of them Polish, sometimes a Swedish guy

296
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,920
- There used to be a rule that you weren’t allowed
to bring machines that weren’t 8-bit,

297
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,080
- and it used to be really strict, but eventually even the 
organizers brought their own stuff, running emulators

298
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,880
- They couldn’t bring phones.

299
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:52,000
- Yeah, phones would be a problem with that rule, my phone 
for example is basically a thousand times faster than a C64.

300
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,600
- We thought about extending the competitions
beyond the usual graphics, music, demo stuff,

301
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:05,240
- but we also try to come up with some playful stuff
you don’t see at other events.

302
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,800
- This year we had a real-life adventure game,
which you had to play in the village itself.

303
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,680
- It had nothing to do with computers,
you just got a map and you had to do quests.

304
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,680
- Oooh, this must be some sort of level
- It’s a f*cking plasma effect!

305
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
- Yeah, it’s a 'sub-subculture' party.

306
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,280
The hype around the Commodore 64 
continues to live on in a variety of ways.

307
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,680
The popularity of music made with the C64 is undiminished.

308
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,800
Today, there are a lot of people experimenting with performing 
C64 music live, whether with an orchestra, or even a cappella.

309
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,200
And of course, there’s been examples of popular
producers getting inspired by C64 music.

310
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,720
SIDRip Alliance is a band who adapts C64 music
to the arsenal of a rock band.

311
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,800
- We were in eighth grade, 
and we were all avid C64 gamers.

312
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,680
- You had a tape recorder where you
could record the music from the television.

313
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,680
- We’d record the music from the TV, and then
we’d listen to it on tape. C64 game music

314
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,160
- So basically you’d listen to game soundtracks?

315
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,000
- Yeah, game and demo soundtrack.

316
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,000
- There’s no sheet music, so you have to figure it out

317
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,080
- It’s hard to make sheet music out of 1, 0, 0, 1

318
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,720
- You only have three channels, and dividing three
channels between six instruments, that’s a rough job.

319
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,400
- I guess the hardest part was that there are a lot of
tracks that were never intended to be played live.

320
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,040
- They don’t have well-defined musical keys, they just 
meander around, and although they do have a method to them,

321
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,400
- you can’t just say “Okay, this is a major scale,” no.

322
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,320
Rearranging C64 music for actual 
instruments is a tricky task,

323
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,440
possibly because on a computer, just creating a single note requires 
a radically different approach than on a physical instrument.

324
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,600
You can’t just pluck a string or press a key.

325
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,160
- There are some similarities between current
synthesizers and oldschool musicmaking;

326
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,120
- they both start out with a sinewave or a triangle wave,
for example, instead of samples.

327
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,480
- You don’t just grab a trumpet, put it behind a 
microphone, and boom, it’s inside the machine.

328
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,680
- No, you take your basic waveforms
and you modulate and tweak them.

329
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,920
- So you have to give a command to the machine in its own 
language saying “Take this sound and modulate it so and so.”

330
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:09,120
- Yeah, take a sinewave, set it to frequency X, say 1kHz, 
turn on the filter, set it to lowpass, cut it off at 2000Hz, and so on.

331
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,560
Vincenzo. Musician, member of 
Conspiracy, Rebels and Fresh!Mindworkz.

332
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,400
Capable of producing music on any machine,
regardless of the number of bits available.

333
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,960
- The C64 SID is pretty limited, 
but you can do a lot of things with it.

334
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,520
- You can only use three channels, which means
you can only play three sounds at once.

335
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,920
- Being creative is exponentially useful here.

336
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:54,800
- This is basically the sheet music. With speed 3, using 
instrument 1, with full volume, you play a note at pitch F-1,

337
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,120
- then it goes on, and here it hits a 'GATE', 
which means it stops the note.

338
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,440
- Then we switch to instrument 0 
with the pitch G-1, and then we mute it.

339
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,880
- The sound generation itself, the editing of the
sound parameters, is done on a different screen.

340
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:25,320
- You start at number 0, you start with the value 41, which means 
'square wave', then a square wave again with modulation C,

341
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:35,040
- which means shifting up an octave,
then 41 00 means 'square wave with no pitch shift'.

342
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,400
- And how do you know that?
- Experience.

343
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,320
- I guess you couldn’t have learned this from a book.
- Experimenting, it’s all about experimenting.

344
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,400
- You have all these basic sounds
you can play around with and combine.

345
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,160
- It’s not that complicated, if you learn the fundamentals,
you can easily make music on a C64.

346
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:03,160
- He’s full of shit, by the way, don’t believe a word what he says,
I heard a demo of his where he had a horse neigh programmed in!

347
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,920
- How did you do that? I mean it really IS a horse neigh!

348
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,280
- Oh easy, 02, 06, 41, 68, 7B

349
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,560
- Limitations forced these people making
computer music to create something out of nothing,

350
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,600
- and you can’t do that without 
an insane amount of genius.

351
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:36,400
- Live act with a Commodore 64? Is that even possible?
- Some people have done it, yeah!

352
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,640
With the appearance of the Amiga and the PC,
music tools evolved further. First, trackers appeared,

353
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,000
bearing a slight resemblance to C64 software,
but with the ability to play back digitized samples,

354
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,480
eventually allowing people to 
write complex pieces of music. 

355
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,240
Today, demo music is written with the newest generation of music 
software, the same tools used for songs you hear on the radio. 

356
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,800
A 4 or 64 kilobyte intro, however, due to the
restrictions in size, can rarely allow digitized sound,

357
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,400
so one must revert to the original approach seen on the C64,
and create sounds using basic waveforms.

358
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:43,440
- How does the demoscene follow musical trends?
Does what’s hot and what’s not matter?

359
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,240
- I told you, I have dubstep poisoning!
- So even demosceners do dubstep?

360
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,800
- Insane amounts! Insane amounts of bigbeat, insane
amounts of drum-and-bass, insane amounts of dubstep.

361
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,200
- Occasionally you get a cool metal demo, 
usually from Finland.

362
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,600
- So there are no restrictions, 
not even within electronic music.

363
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:09,920
- Not at all. There’s ambient, there’s even a lot of drone 
ambient, where it’s the same buzzing note for ten minutes.

364
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,720
- I can think of demos with samba soundtracks, 
but it’s not really a trend.

365
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,440
- Despite them being computer music,
they’re really catchy, there’s a lot of genius in there,

366
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,400
- and if these tracks had been written commercially,
they would’ve been hits. Their melodic style guarantees it.

367
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:58,120
- Mostly demoscene musicians are just demoscene musicians.
- I see, so they are separated from the musical scene.

368
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,560
- Not completely separated, but yeah, you find
demoscene musicians doing cool drum-and-bass tracks,

369
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,760
- and they will only release them in the
demoscene, and nowhere else.

370
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:26,520
- Commercially exploiting the music of a demo is just so far
from the philosophy of it all; nobody is really interested in that.

371
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:33,840
- The problem is that the quality and popularity
of music isn’t always on the same level. 

372
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:41,040
- I mean I’m not sure if you can hear it in the background,
there’s some brilliant electronic stuff you can hear now,

373
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,640
- but what goes on in the outside world? “Come on Barbie girl”

374
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:55,640
Computers' graphical capabilities have evolved considerably
over the past thirty years, simultaneously with their musical ones.

375
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,720
Today, artists use tools to create a 3D model
that makes the workflow similar to sculpting an actual statue. 

376
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,360
20-25 years ago, in the age of the C64,
graphics artists found themselves facing limitations 

377
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,640
that made drawing pictures pixel-by-pixel the fastest way.

378
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,680
- This software is keyboard-controlled.

379
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:36,120
- That’s what makes it so fast to work with, if you get used to it 
and get used to its features, then you can draw with it relatively fast.

380
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:44,400
- And when you zoom out to full screen,
here you can only view the picture.

381
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:53,680
The biggest challenge, however, is that while the C64 only has 
16 colors, it can only display 2 or 4 colors on a single character.

382
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,800
Drawing applications mark these character limits with a grid.

383
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,680
- See, you can see that I can’t use orange here anymore,

384
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,200
- because I’m already using three colors
in this character besides the black background.

385
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:19,160
- So this is where you start doing tricks,
swapping some colors so you won’t notice.

386
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,480
- Your eye won’t necessarily be able to discern
if a couple of pixels are the wrong color. 

387
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:41,040
- That’s part of the beauty of pixel art,
you gotta adhere to the limitations.

388
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:53,960
- Putting it together dot by dot isn’t enough,
you have to pay attention to the limitations of the hardware.

389
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:09,040
- If you look at most C64 graphics artists who produce 
pictures today, most of them don’t use a C64 anymore.

390
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:16,520
- There are a lot of cross-platform tools, which means it’s
running on a different platform, you have a lot more features,

391
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,720
- but it’s designed to make the end result viewable on a C64.

392
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,720
- The newest fad is to make converters
instead of drawing tools.

393
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,840
- This means you can use any image editor on the PC,
hand the result over to the tool,

394
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:50,160
- and it tries to figure out a way to present the picture
on the C64 in the best looking way possible.

395
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,800
Here, the programmers compete in using undocumented,
essentially faulty functionalities of the computer

396
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:02,480
to create more versatile video modes which can be used 
to produce pictures in higher resolutions or with more colors.

397
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,040
The rules of these modes are so complex that keeping
them all in mind while drawing is practically impossible,

398
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,800
which is why tools are written
to convert finished pictures to such formats.

399
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,640
- You can’t humanly comprehend 
these types of limitations anymore.

400
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:26,960
- Stuff like, “I can use the background color in every
third character, if it’s a wide pixel, and above it,

401
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:36,120
- in every raster line I can use three other colors,
and then,” whatever. You can’t keep this stuff in mind.

402
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:52,560
- The crazy thing is, new video modes for the C64
are still being found today, stuff you’d think isn’t possible.

403
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:00,120
- Every year we think “nah, this is the limit, 
you can’t do more,” and still someone always does.

404
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:06,720
- So chipretro is blossoming and the limits can still be pushed.
- They’re certainly pushing the envelope, yeah!

405
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,240
The progress in computer science has
obviously upgraded the visuals as well.

406
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,360
Nowadays, the tools used for 
making pictures shown at demoparties

407
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,160
are the same tools used for creating
popular animated films or computer games.

408
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,400
It’s possible, however, to find 
subgenres unique to the demoscene, 

409
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,840
such as logos, which are meant to display text
in a spectacular manner, similar to graffiti.

410
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,960
These logos sometimes appear next to the demo
in the informational text files as well,

411
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,320
in which case they are recreated by only using
the ASCII character set of the computer.

412
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:57,160
In the 80s and 90s, it wasn’t just the production process
of such artworks that was more difficult than today.

413
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:04,520
Without the Internet, general communication and the distribution
of such works was performed the analog way, through ordinary mail.

414
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,400
'Swappers' who eventually created
their own networks across the globe,

415
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,640
put demos, games, and copies of other software
onto floppies and exchanged them via postal mail.

416
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:22,640
- We, mailtraders, have one-hundred contacts with other 
people. And we were some kind of peer-to-peer network.

417
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:30,240
- I have stuff from these guys, I write a letter,
pack all the stuffs and send it to the other guys.

418
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,800
- It was important, if you had something new,
you had to get it out to these other people.

419
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:40,280
- Here in Hungary, you had guys who had more than
five-hundred contacts sending stuff via ordinary mail.

420
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,960
- Who the mailman had to do an extra round for.

421
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:51,440
- We have full envelopes of floppys,
four floppys, eight floppys all around Europe.

422
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,800
- So I had let’s say twenty huge 
envelopes in my postbox every day.

423
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:03,080
- Swappers were important people that time in the 
groups, because they would distribute your stuff.

424
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:13,000
- After every party I released a pack. All the intros
from that party was included in the pack.

425
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,400
Demos and applications weren’t the
only things to be distributed via mail.

426
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,080
Teams of self-appointed editors 
started so-called diskmagazines.

427
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,600
These weren’t just textfiles, but executable
programs displaying their content.

428
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,640
- You had a disk, a PRG file, and it was a magazine,
you loaded it, you selected a category, news, columns, etc.

429
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:48,000
- And then you sent it to friends, acquaintances,
neighbours, and that’s how it spread around.

430
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,920
- If you go back to these early diskmags,
you’ll see terms like "Stamps back!”

431
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:06,000
- You know, guys were trying to They didn’t have that much money, 
but you know, you had to keep up all your contacts you had.

432
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,040
- And if you had a hundred contacts, 
you’d say "Stamps back!”,

433
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,080
- meaning send my stamps back to me,
so I can use them or try to use them again.

434
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,760
In these days, even downloading wasn’t the same.

435
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,560
To be exact, the correct term would be “downwhistling”.

436
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:33,040
- It was in the middle of the 80s when Hungarian national TV
and radio had some experimental broadcasts,

437
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,560
- where they 'whistled down' software.

438
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:48,960
- Basically, if you save a C64 program 
to a cassette tape, you get this bleepy noise. 

439
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,720
- And then they took this noise, broadcast it, 
and you could record it.

440
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:01,640
- So if you had a cassette tape recorder, they’d say
“Commodore users, Spectrum users, start recording,”

441
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:08,200
- you’d record it, take the cassette, and use it
to load the programe on a C64 or Spectrum.

442
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,120
Today, PC demos or intros are 
generally made in one of two ways:

443
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,440
Either from scratch, programming 
the demo from the ground up, 

444
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,520
or by utilizing a demotool created 
by the coder of the group.

445
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:43,400
- Demomaking, the way I used to do it for example, if I wanted 
to make a 3D object, back then in the group Digital Dynamite,

446
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:52,000
- I'd draw a 3D blueprint of the letter D
on graph paper, then use the grid to say

447
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:02,280
- "Okay, this point in the top left will be 0,0;
one square is a unit, so the next on will be 2,0"

448
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:14,080
- I wrote down the numbers, typed them in, and eventually
somehow managed to display it, because it was in the memory.

449
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:23,480
- I did this a lot of times, and it got on my nerves, so I said “Okay,
I’m gonna write a program that creates the source code for me!” 

450
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:31,080
- So I just plot the letter D somehow,
and it spits out the source code.

451
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:52,640
- If I needed to cite 'real life' examples, then our tool is
Photoshop, 3D Studio, and Premiere combined. 

452
00:55:52,640 --> 00:56:01,160
- They allow you to create textures procedurally,
create 3D models, animate them, edit the animated 3D scenes,

453
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,240
- and then you press the spacebar and the demo is played.

454
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:13,320
- We don’t use commercial tools, because
we do 64k intros, we wanna make small files.

455
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,400
- We needed specialized tools, so we made some.

456
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:31,840
- So this is basically the timeline. That little
white cursor shows where we are in the intro.

457
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:38,200
- This is kinda like Premiere, a standard video editor. 

458
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:47,160
- These are various events, for example these are
post-processing effects, like contrast, blur, stuff like that.

459
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:53,360
- See, this is a complete 3D model, 
put together in this tool.

460
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:02,360
- We don’t work by defining triangles, we instead say
“here’s a torus, with this radius and this number of points.”

461
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,600
- That’s storing three parameters 
instead of twelve thousand points.

462
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,840
- That’s what 64k is about: using three
parameters instead of twelve thousand points.

463
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,360
These incredibly small sizes are achieved by creating
intros with binary program code and its parameters

464
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,200
instead of using large pre-generated
3D models, pictures, videos, or music files.

465
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,880
The computer then uses these parameters
and algorithms to produce the visuals and sound.

466
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:43,120
- It’s all built out of images like that. There’s nothing mindblowing
in there, but the end result is really well tied together.

467
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,200
- This is not a water simulation, 
even though it looks like one.

468
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,640
- Those are not real sparkles, even though
it looks like the sun is reflecting back.

469
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:08,440
- So none of these are simulations of real things,
just different methods made to look like the real thing.

470
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:22,280
- These are the events being rendered, for example this layer
is the clouds behind the sun, not sure if you can see it.

471
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:29,360
- The next one is the sky, 
a simple rectangle with a color gradient.

472
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:37,080
- The next one is the water, you can see
that it’s just a simple texture scrolling.

473
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:44,960
- The next one is the sparkles on the water,
which are simple particles.

474
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:56,480
- The trick is that we have this effect where you can offset 
lines horizontally, and if you apply it, it looks like water flowing,

475
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:04,720
- you have the scrolling texture 
and it has sparkles of light on it.

476
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,960
- So with this stuff you can do really
spectacular things in a really small size for a 64k.

477
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,240
Of course, not everyone wants to make a demotool.

478
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,720
Some people have more fun starting from scratch
every time they make a demo.

479
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:36,880
- I’ll draw three times forty lines, and
I’ll have the camera rotate around it.

480
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,880
- Here we have the lines, and now
we start adding effects one by one. 

481
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,520
- First, let’s bend them.

482
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,800
- This is the line that makes them bend,
here’s how it works:

483
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:01,040
- you have the center of those little axes there, XYZ coordinates, 
and I’m going to rotate them using their distance from the origin,

484
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:07,000
- multiply it with a sine value
depending on the time, do this on two axes,

485
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,280
- then write the result back to the original
XYZ vector, and render them on screen.

486
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:23,080
- Let’s say I want the lines to be longer
if they’re farther from the origin.

487
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:30,800
- V stands for the length of the lines: it’s the distance
from the origin, meaning the absolute value of i, divided by ten.

488
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:38,240
- That’s why they’re longer when they’re farther away, because
if the coordinates are bigger, it means they’re farther off.

489
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,560
- Down here I add V to the coordinates: X, then Y, then Z.

490
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,560
The complexity of program code can grow infinitely;

491
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:59,040
even among the most spectacular demos you can find some
where the demo was created entirely from scratch,

492
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,680
without the use of a demotool or other such software.

493
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,920
With time, works that cannot be classified as music,
graphics or demos have appeared.

494
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,720
This gave birth to  the 'wild' category.

495
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:27,320
- It can be a really well rendered animation,
a short film, or any sort of horrible crap.

496
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,040
Murphy. Coder, graphics artist, member of Exceed.

497
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,240
The editor of Scene.hu, 
and a genuine demoscene encyclopedia.

498
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:46,600
- A few years back, I think it was at Breakpoint, they had 
a wild entry which was this huge machine they pushed on stage,

499
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:54,120
- they had a 3x3x3 or 8x8x8 LED cube, and all sorts of 
blinking crap on it, and it just stood there doing it’s thing.

500
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:01,600
- There’s been liveacts at wild compos, meaning
it wasn’t projected, but people went up on stage.

501
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:21,400
- Someone takes a microcontroller from
a refrigerator and makes a demo for it

502
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,360
- But we can safely consider it a joke!
- No!

503
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,040
- Okay, sure, when he’s making 
it he considers it dead serious.

504
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,160
- Yeah, and when you’re watching it, you’re watching it
seriously because it goes on for three minutes,

505
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,560
- it has good looking effects, great music,

506
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:42,360
- it’s just that when it starts off, and he mentions that 
this is a microcontroller used in the whatever brand of refrigerators,

507
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,440
you can’t helping think “Riiiight, let’s see”.

508
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,720
- At some point someone made a production for a really extreme 
platform, and they’ve been trying to top each other ever since.

509
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:14,440
- Practically speaking, there are no platforms in the world 
which haven’t had demoscene activity on them at some point.

510
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,160
- From pocket calculators to apartment buildings.

511
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,520
While they don’t strictly tie in to the scene,
one could perhaps classify the animations

512
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,440
which are displayed on the wall 
of the 18-story Schönherz dormitory

513
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,920
at Budapest University of Technology every year
during the Schönherz Qpa a wild demo.

514
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,320
Originally, this merely meant using lamps
placed in the dorm room windows, 

515
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:43,080
but from 2010, the display was upgraded to provide a higher 
resolution and colors for the event entitled The Matrix.

516
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,800
- In Hungary, you had this competition called the 
'lamer demo'. It didn’t really take root anywhere else.

517
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,040
- Not our fault!

518
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:09,160
- The idea was that most of the wild demos were meant 
to be 'funny', so why not make a separate compo for them?

519
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:15,960
You have the nicest hair in the world! Can I touch it?
Wait, I didn’t mean that, NO!

520
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,040
- For a few years, this was the most popular compo.

521
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,480
- Yeah, ‘cos you didn’t really need
large amounts of technical knowledge,

522
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,640
- you just took some primitive animation,
and added some “hilarious” music or voiceover.

523
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,280
- There were some genuinely funny ones,
but most of them were just exhausting.

524
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:42,880
This child will start using Windows at the age of 38,
get a heart attack at the age of 40, and die at the age of 41.

525
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,800
The demoscene is the most popular today 
in Germany and Northern Europe. 

526
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,320
These countries also host the largest annual parties as well.

527
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:03,600
Breakpoint, in Germany, held 8 times until 2010, hosted more 
than a thousand people from almost 30 countries around the world.

528
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,800
Similarly grandiose are Assembly in Finland, 
or The Gathering in Norway,

529
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,840
which both originated as demoparties, but are now
open for the masses of computer gamers as well.

530
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,800
Smaller events occur all over the world, and the number 
of productions released so far have grown over 50000.

531
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:27,440
The roster is obviously huge, so becoming one of 
the best and most recognized isn’t an easy task.

532
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,400
But from time to time, Hungarian groups
have proven their place among the best,

533
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,520
presenting artists whose reputation 
spreads across continents.

534
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:45,480
- NVIDIA was organizing a demoparty in San Jose,
in the US, and they asked Gargaj to host the event!

535
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:51,600
- They wanted someone authentic, so they took
a Hungarian dude to the US to speak English!

536
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:57,200
- There are always a few groups
who are remarkable, sometimes British,

537
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,640
- sometimes Norwegian, sometimes German, 
sometimes Finnish.

538
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,280
- And yeah, sometimes Hungarian groups
manage to make their way to the top as well.

539
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:17,400
Conspiracy is one of these groups, formed in 2002
by members of the 3 most active groups at the time.

540
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,640
- We appeared in the scene with this group
to challenge the kings of 64k at the time,

541
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:29,840
- the ones who bludgeoned anyone to the point
that people withdrew releases from compos

542
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:36,120
- when they found out that there’s a Farbrausch intro,
because they had no chance!

543
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,920
- And with our first release, 
we just blew them away!

544
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,080
- Conspiracy showed up at Breakpoint, 
has a four-parter, you know,

545
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:50,120
- four whole complete demo parts in one 64K intro,
which was astounding!

546
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,360
- Is still going?

547
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,440
- Is STILL going???

548
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:12,400
- We made it in complete secret, nobody knew
that we had an intro, nobody even knew that we existed.

549
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,720
- We wanted a blockbuster effect,
you know, boom, here we are! And it worked!

550
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:35,480
- We’re sitting there at the competition, the intros are 
playing, and some of the last ones are being played,

551
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:43,120
- ‘cuz you never know how many intros are there, they 
never tell you, you just go “Oh another one! Excellent!”

552
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:50,800
- So there were some good ones, then Farbrausch’s 
intro gets played, which is a really damn good intro,

553
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:58,640
- the first intro to have an animated human person,
a naked chick for good measure, so go figure!

554
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:13,640
- So their intro ends, everyone thinks the compo is over,
and then they start playing ours as the last one.

555
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:22,520
- Tomcat is sitting behind me going “They might as well just
not play this one!” ‘Cuz you know, Farbrausch was just that good.

556
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:32,480
- So we had our intro, Project Genesis, and it’s ten minutes long,
very very versatile, and there are parts in it for everyone to like.

557
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,080
- We put a huge logo in the front saying 'Conspiracy',

558
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:50,960
- no-one knew what the hell who they were or what 
they wanted, but we left the actual credits to the end.

559
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:59,720
- We used realtime cloth simulation to put out a Hungarian 
flag, and we had our names appear in front of it.

560
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:05,200
- So when my name appears, 
Tomcat punches me in the shoulder

561
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,840
- and goes 
“F*ck you, you bastards never mentioned this!”

562
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:22,160
- Gargaj just jumped up, and started waving the
Hungarian flag in the front row, that was excellent.

563
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:42,960
Their initial success was followed by even more. Their 64k intro 
Chaos Theory is possibly the best known Hungarian intro in the world. 

564
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:50,280
It’s popularity and reverence is best shown by the fact that the 
French demogroup FRequency created a 4k remix for MAIN 2010.

565
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,440
- Two weeks ago, we were searching for an idea
to do a quick compo for the 4k.

566
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:08,520
- We were watching demos like usually
late at night with friends and we thought: 

567
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,840
- Hey, why not take a 64k and try to make it into 4k?

568
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:21,120
- And when we said this, the first 64k
that came into our mind was Chaos Theory.

569
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,640
- It’s really famous in the intro scene,

570
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:41,040
- beacuse it’s quite the first demo to have such an
entertaining music and such complex visual in a so tight size.

571
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,280
Of course, Conspiracy isn’t the only
Hungarian group we can be proud of. 

572
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,480
Exceed, in 2000, made demo history when they won
both of the biggest demoparties in one year.

573
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:14,480
Their 64k intro Heaven 7 is still considered to be among one of the 
best to this day, and their demo Spot won Assembly in Finland.

574
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,120
The list of Hungarian groups’ successes could go on:

575
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:23,920
On the C64, the demo Soiled Legacy by Resource used to be 
considered as one of the 10 best demos on the platform for years.

576
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,800
- The funny thing is, this sort of 
Hungarian spirit exists in the scene too.

577
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,480
- Consider the period of time around 
the Olympics in Barcelona or Sydney,

578
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,120
- when the entire country was rooting for Egerszegi Krisztina,
Kovács Ági, Darnyi Tamás, Nagy Tímea.

579
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:52,360
- I think this kind of support can be felt by demogroups too,
we know we’re a little handicapped due to the history,

580
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,840
- we’re sort of the underdogs,

581
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:01,400
- and that creates that Hungarian spirit where you
get a small team just blowing away the competition!

582
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,920
- So what happened around ‘91-’92?

583
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:22,400
- It was unusual because this being the Eastern Bloc,
even the active sceners had a problem with the language barrier.

584
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:36,480
- There was a huge group of people though. We had
demoparties with over a thousand people here in Hungary.

585
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:47,720
- The scene was huge back then, and we were fine on our own,
‘cos there were years where you had six to eight parties.

586
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:55,120
- There’s been years where you had as many parties
as four other countries combined

587
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,880
- so much stuff was happening 
that we were doing fine or our own.

588
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:11,560
- To show how successful Hungarians are, 
there’s a site called Pouët,

589
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:17,080
- which is the biggest demoscene site and
has almost all the prods you can think of. 

590
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,240
- It has a Top Ten chart of the most popular demos,

591
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:25,880
- and I don’t know how it is now, but there used to be
a time where three out of ten were Hungarian ones.

592
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,280
- So what's the highest honour for your work?

593
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,360
- When you win a party, especially if you win
against people who were doing their best.

594
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,960
- It depends I guess. My favorite recognition
is the kind where someone comes up at a party

595
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,320
- and says “whoa, you’re the one who made the wow.”

596
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:47,560
- You know, when you can see that the work has travelled
all the way down the chain, to people who only heard of it,

597
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,480
- and are surprised as they go
“Wow, you made that? I saw it so many times, I loved it!”

598
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,280
- Indeed, that’s the best, when they don’t know you made it
and they find out. I think that’s the best kind of recognition.

599
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:07,680
One of the idiosyncratic motifs of mutual
reverence in demos are the 'greetings',

600
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,080
where the creators of the demo pay respect
to the groups they greatly admire.

601
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,280
Being greeted in a demo made by one of the
popular groups is considered a badge of honor, 

602
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,520
as it expresses that they consider 
your work to be one of the best.

603
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,000
- So do you have 'celebrities' or 'legends' in Hungary?

604
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,760
- Legends are made by people who are younger, for example 
I guess today it’s Gargaj and his group who are the most popular,

605
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,560
- so for newcomers, they’re the ones 
who are considered legends.

606
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,120
- You’ve been legends too!

607
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:51,200
- Yeah, I read diskmag articles about Murphy. It’s really
bizarre to meet someone you’ve read so much about!

608
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,160
Occasionally, a demo becomes 
popular outside the scene as well.

609
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:05,680
- I’m in Szeged, piss-drunk, and above me, two guys are
talking about 64k intros and Conspiracy and stuff like that.

610
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:11,040
- I look up, ask “What? you know Conspiracy?”
“Yeah! They’re awesome!”

611
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,800
- “Hi, I’m BoyC.” Dude’s eyes widen, he goes
“the f*ck are you doing here?” 

612
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,840
- “What? I came to see a concert”

613
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:32,320
- We were boozing next to the ELTE around the ZP, and 
these three girls show up, some friend brought them along,

614
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:39,080
- and a buddy asks me to show them Chaos Theory,
‘coz I had a video of it on my phone.

615
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,880
- So I show it to one of the girls, and she goes
“Oh I know, we studied this one!”

616
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,240
The demoscene is dead.

617
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,720
- The phrase "the scene is dead"
has been around for the past thirty years.

618
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:08,880
- I joined the scene around ’98, and already in ‘98
people were trying to bury it or well, it was different!

619
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:17,640
- Fifteen years ago you had half a dozen or
a dozen parties a year, and that dropped off a lot.

620
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:28,880
When we did SCEnEST in ‘96, we had twelve-hundred 
paying visitors! That was one hell of a party!

621
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:43,440
- The generation who were attending high school later
went to university, grew up, whoops, family happened,

622
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:49,600
- work happened, everything happened, and
the enthusiasm is still there, but the time isn’t.

623
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,720
- Really sitting down to make a good demo,
the last time that happened, was in 1999.

624
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:00,960
- Now it’s no group, no demo?
- No, not really, there are always plans, but it never happens.

625
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,440
- Why?
- Because I’m old!

626
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:08,400
- And you can’t write demos now?
- I can but

627
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:14,480
- I’m old and lazy. No, I mean,
I don’t have the time, or rather, the mood.

628
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,680
- You go home after working ten hours - don’t laugh

629
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:25,960
- ten hours in the office, you don’t really wanna go home
and do the same thing afterwards, it doesn’t work.

630
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:38,440
- There’s still a new generation, but they’re not as 
numerous as they used to be in the “golden era”.

631
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,240
- To create a demo there is a lot of work involved within.

632
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,280
- And not necessarily the same instant feedback
and gratification you can get from, say,

633
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,160
- making a YouTube video in five minutes,
and then you get like fifty thousand hits

634
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,720
- from people telling you that either 
it’s brilliant or that you suck.

635
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,520
- You don’t get that in the demoscene,

636
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,560
- you might get like twelve people saying how brilliant 
it is and three hundred people tell you, that it sucks.

637
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:09,680
- So the payoff isn’t necessarily there for kids to say:
“I want to spend that amount of time”.

638
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:19,040
- Back then Orange was a great example who could go from zero to 
hero in a year just by working hard to produce something world class.

639
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,520
- Today, if you start from scratch, it takes about four years.

640
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:31,280
- A viral video on the Internet lasts what?
Less than 15 minutes of fame.

641
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:39,920
- But, you know a demo we remember demos from last year,
the year before, ten years ago, fifteen years ago.

642
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:47,480
- If you could put out a rotating cube on the screen,
you were the king. The standards are so different now. 

643
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:55,120
- Think about it, you go to the movies, watch Avatar,
that’s the kind of quality you’re up against.

644
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:15,080
- That’s why you have to help them. It’s almost as if you
have to prepare them mentally to create their first demo.

645
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:24,000
- Yeah, it is a problem that they don’t dare to, but it’s a pretty
silly attitude, if you can’t then you can’t, but you at least tried.

646
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,440
- It’s all about the attitude. The point is whether you
want to be successful in the scene or just want to be present. 

647
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:37,720
- If you want to be successful, you have to write a tool,
work for years, find a graphics artist, find a designer.

648
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,720
- If you just wanna have fun, 
just sit down and make some demos.

649
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:53,760
- Think about it; the scene is a rather technically-oriented,
artistic, computer-centric, underground, free-for-all thing.

650
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,400
- Are you surprised that it’s not popular?!

651
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:06,160
- I think it’s normal, you have the Internet now, console this,
console that, kids are occupied by different things.

652
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:12,240
- Back then, you know, we didn’t have the Internet,
we just hacked away on our little computers we bought 

653
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:19,320
- We bought? I mean our parents bought!
And we thought it was really interesting, what we could do.

654
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,120
- In any given city you had a limited number of computers,
and some people started doing creative things on them,

655
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,840
-  in some way it was a privilege. Nowadays, everyone
uses computers, so you can’t really spread that far.

656
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:38,120
- If kids sit down in front of the Internet today, they have
the whole world in front of them, they do what they want,

657
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,800
- they play games, they browse. It’s different,
the world works differently now.

658
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:56,600
- You gotta realize, back in ‘95, the most spectacular things
you could see on a computer were demos.

659
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:02,720
- Games were mostly still 2D at the time,
they were a step behind. 

660
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:11,920
- They were way beyond games made by professional studios,
they were capable of producing better quality.

661
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,440
- Now all you have to do is to go to YouTube,

662
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,680
- and check out the showreels of the ten best
VFX studios to see what the top of the line is.

663
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,440
- We didn’t have Toy Story and things like that. 

664
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,040
- Now someone can go to the movies, and then see 
a 4k intro, and obviously wonder what the point is?!

665
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:45,040
- You can’t really visually match up a cutscene made with hundreds 
of man-months of work with the spare-time activity of 5-6 people.

666
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,560
- So it’s more about new ideas nowadays.

667
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:01,080
- The older ones are always complaining
about the lack of newcomers,

668
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:07,680
- but there’s always a few new groups, new guys,
they learn their chops, and they evolve.

669
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:19,280
- I’ll say this: I’m really really lucky to have the demoscene.
I feel very fortunate, and it worked out really well.

670
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,120
- So how did you find it?

671
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:27,560
- I was looking for programming stuff,
and I accidentally stumbled upon it.

672
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,160
- And when I saw it, I just thought, 
“Wow, what’s this, this is so cool!”

673
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,960
MaxUser6000. Travelled all the way from Transylvania
to Budapest to present his first demo ever at Function 2010.

674
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,520
- When my demo was running, 
my heart started beating really fast!

675
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,880
- Like a band playing on stage?
- Exactly, like a band on stage!

676
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,600
- So what was your aim when you sat down to 
make a demo? ‘Cos there is pretty tough competition.

677
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,080
- Do you wanna place well? Or win?

678
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:10,280
- I was just thinking of the demo, to make a demo that doesn’t
assault the audience too much, maybe they’ll even enjoy it a bit.

679
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,040
- That’s what I planned, 
and it turned out better than I intended!

680
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:29,480
“Better than intended” in this case means that the demo
finished first in the demo competition after the audience vote.

681
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,480
And while there isn’t much to be gained apart from
recognition and some modest prizes from the sponsors,

682
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,320
there’s a chance that experience gained in the 
scene will provide him with a good job offer.

683
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:43,680
- The biggest job market for demosceners
is obviously game development,

684
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,040
- or sometimes people end up working 
for animation studios.

685
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,880
- I for one ended up as a game developer,

686
01:23:52,880 --> 01:24:00,960
- because the CEO of one of the older game development 
companies used to attend parties to headhunt new talent.

687
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:08,120
- I don’t want to lie, but for me, for about 7-8 years, this was
just a hobby, for 7-8 years I was just making music constantly.

688
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:13,440
- Then I reached the point where 
I was able to make a living out of it, 

689
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,760
- because I did it for so long that
the demoscene became a springboard for me.

690
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,240
- It’s a great sandbox to learn in, if you do something,
you get immediate feedback.

691
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:32,760
- Your demo is played, the crowd is jeering, they’ll 
tell you immediately if it was crap or if it was great.

692
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:41,440
- And you can learn a lot from this
how to put it, blunt and unfiltered feedback.

693
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,880
- You learn what works and what doesn’t.

694
01:24:53,120 --> 01:25:06,080
- The people who started this in the early-mid-’90s, they’re
probably all working for some game development studio now,

695
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:13,360
- or some sort of visual effects or post-production company.

696
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,400
- These people really know their stuff, you know?

697
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:27,160
- And they work in really big companies 
like Pixar, or Apple, Microsoft.

698
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:35,160
These people not only work for some of the biggest companies, many 
European game development studios were founded by demosceners. 

699
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:40,040
Demogroups were responsible for the birth of DICE,
creator of the Battlefield series;

700
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,440
or Remedy, authors of games 
like Max Payne and Alan Wake.

701
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,480
Several demo musicians have also worked on
successful game soundtracks as well, 

702
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,000
such as Assassins’ Creed or the Unreal series.

703
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,120
We’ve also seen multinational corporations such as NVIDIA, Intel 
or Microsoft organize their own demoparties or demo competitions,

704
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,320
providing their own tools for the creators to produce with.

705
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,480
Artists in the scene aren’t motivated 
by publicity or worldwide success.

706
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:53,560
As professional they are, their works are only intended for
those few hundred people who understand and appreciate them. 

707
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,800
Their works may be world class, yet they don’t seem to mind
that the world itself has probably never heard of them.

708
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:04,200
- The demoscene is an amateur league.
People don’t take it as seriously.

709
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:10,520
- I mean, even if the coder and the graphics artist put
something extraordinary in the demo, it’s still a hobby.

- If the musician writes a great song
that could be a hit single, it’s still a hobby.

- It’s about showing your production to
that very small circle of people.

01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:26,320
- I don’t want to do something that interests everyone,

Whether we color the future or let it fade to gray,
ultimately, depends on us.
